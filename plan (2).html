<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Bonnie Thompson<br>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The purpose of the website is to improve the number of sales for Cossieplay, a small family-run custom cosplay and fancy dress business. With only 4 costumes made and purchased each week and a mere 30 people attending the monthy parties, there is not enough revenue to sustain the business. The website will provide more marketing and a closer relationship with customers or potential customers which should improve purchases. Another goal of the website is to appeal to a younger audience as current buyers are usually around 35 - 50 years, only allowing for a small group target audience. Marketing the strong sense of creativity, showcasing designs and enjoyment of dressing up will entice viewers to become involved with cosplay and potentially purchase costumes from CossiePlay. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Determining the sucessfulness of the website will be shown through an increase in costume purchases through the websites marketing system. It will also be shown by an increase of attendants at the monthly cosplay party as well as an increase is younger cosplayers attending and purchasing from Cossieplay. To determine whether more people are noticing the announcements through the website, counting the number of cosplayers that get the free drink from KFC or the number of emails collected would be reasonable. To see if more new people are attending the parties, the number of 50% discounts can be calculated. This will provide insight into whether the website is bringing in more new customers and potentially younger customers.   </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>1. The initial target audience will be younger ages as there is large oppurtinity for young people to become more involved compared to the small numbers there are now. The secondary target audience are families and young adults as this would bring larger groups of people purchacing as well as parents bringing their children which is one of the main goals. </p>
<p>2. The design of the website will be intentially themed toward the target audience to cater to this group. To appeal to the younger generation the site will be colourful and have lots of images as well as obviously showing the teenager and child discounts. Showing images of young children dressed up as well as the discounts will entice familiesor young adults as well. Showing the "sign up now" option and "children under six years get in free" deal in a very obvious way will be used as a call to arms. Mentioning the free drinks, dancing live DJ and KFC will also cater to young peoples desires. Mentioning the service of alcohol may also entice young adults to attend.  </p>
